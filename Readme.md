**CREDIT RISK ANALYSIS**

**OVERVIEW**

The purpose of the exercise is to apply machine learning to credit risk - which is an inherently unbalanced classification problem.  We are trying to predict high risk loans using a dataset from LendingClub, a company that provides credit card data.  We looked at 6 different machine learning models in order to accurately sample all of the data.  We first oversampled, then undersampled.  After that, we used a combinational over and under sampling approach - before finally using two machine learning models to most accurately predict credit risk.



NAIVE RANDOM OVERSAMPLING 

 The balanced accuracy score is (64.63%) 
 
 The low risk precision score is (100%) - sensitivity of (58%) 
 
 The high risk precision score is (1%) - sensitivity of 71%

**SUMMARY**
The Easy Ensemble Classifier is significantly more accurate in identifying high risk credit loans then any other machine learning model.  The 92% accuracy in regards to recall of high risk loans outperforms the rest of the field by a wide margin.  It is also more precise in identifying high credit risk loans and ranks as having the highest accuracy.  Although the precision score is only 9%, it still ranks 3 times better then the next closest machine learning model.
